使用元件:LCD、4*4鍵盤、8LED、搖桿、蜂鳴器還有可變電阻
該程式共有四種執行模式:
1.待機模式":LCD待機畫面顯示『按下E開始遊戲』，透過4*4鍵盤的"E"鍵進入選擇難度模式。
2.選擇難度模式:LCD顯示『按下A Normal B Hard』透過A、B還有C(隱藏模式)來選擇難度，選完後進入工作模式。
   i.模式A(普通難度):跳過秒數為五秒
  ii.模式B(困難模式):跳過秒數為三秒
 iii.模式C(隱藏模式):根據旋轉電阻設定秒數;最久為10秒，最快則1秒且可在工作模式中任意調整。
3.工作模式(遊玩模式):近去之後過兩秒顯示『Ready...』一秒後『Go!』並顯示目前成績跟秒數，LCD第一行顯示UP、Right、Down或Left根據出現字來操作搖桿，其中有八次機會可以失誤，每失誤一次LED會滅一顆，或者時間經過各難度設置的秒數後會滅一顆，八顆滅或時間到進入結束模式。
4.結束模式:LCD顯示成績、失誤次數，發出500ms蜂鳴器，並按下E後可以重新進入選擇難度模式遊玩。

Components Used: LCD, 4x4 Keypad, 8 LEDs, Joystick, Buzzer, and Variable Resistor.

The program has four execution modes:

1.Standby Mode: The LCD displays the message "Press E to start the game." The user can press the "E" key on the 4x4 keypad to enter the difficulty selection mode.

2.Difficulty Selection Mode: The LCD shows "Press A for Normal, B for Hard." Users can choose the difficulty by pressing A, B, or C (Hidden Mode). After selection, the program enters the working mode.

i. Mode A (Normal Difficulty): The skip time is five seconds.
ii. Mode B (Hard Difficulty): The skip time is three seconds.
iii. Mode C (Hidden Mode): The skip time is set according to the rotation of the variable resistor; the maximum is 10 seconds, the minimum is 1 second, and it can be adjusted at any time during the working mode.
3.Working Mode (Gameplay Mode): After entering this mode, it will display "Ready..." for two seconds, followed by "Go!" for one second, along with the current score and seconds. The first line of the LCD displays UP, Right, Down, or Left, and the joystick must be operated according to the displayed direction. There are eight chances for mistakes; each mistake causes one LED to turn off. Additionally, if the time exceeds the set seconds for each difficulty, one LED will also turn off. The game ends when all eight LEDs are off or when time runs out.

4.End Mode: The LCD displays the score and the number of mistakes, emits a 500 ms sound from the buzzer, and pressing "E" allows the user to re-enter the difficulty selection mode to play again.
